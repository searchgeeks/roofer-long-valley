    <p>One day roof install! Tito and his crew and Ryan and Jenn in the office made the experience easy and pain free. The crew was here early and set to work right away. The roof looks great. They fixed a few problems that were found. Sent me pictures and pricing in real time. Clean up was great and fast. Took care of a screen that was damaged and had another contractor come fix a safety switch on the A/C. Would highly recommend Proven for siding/roofing. The team is great!</p>

    <p>Proven Roofing did a fabulous job on our roof. They were here bright and early ready to complete the job. They worked tirelessly to get the job done in a timely manner. They were thorough, neat, receptive and hard-working.  At the end of the job, they cleaned up everything and were meticulous.  Tito did a great job managing the crew.  If you are in need of a new roof, do not hesitate to hire them.</p>

    <p>3.5 years after Proven replaced our roof and gutters I reached out to them needing more gutter downspouts. i wanted to redo how the downspouts entered the underground drain pipes and need longer downspout pieces. Jenn and Dave engaged in my project, worked to understand what I needed and then dropped off two 10ft downspouts free of charge. i would have paid if they asked but they didn't!
100% A+
thanks Jenn, thanks Dave and team!!</p>
